echo "1. User logs in with @agency.com email\n";
echo "2. System detects agency domain and redirects to password recovery page\n";
echo "3. User updates their name, password, and contact information\n";
echo "4. Information is validated, password is hashed, and all data is saved\n";
echo "5. User is redirected to agency dashboard\n";
echo "6. On subsequent logins, the process repeats for security (password update required each login)\n";
