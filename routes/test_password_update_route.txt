This file documents the intended route flow for agency password updates:

1. Route Configuration (web.php)
   - route('agency.password.recover') -> UserController@showAgencyPasswordRecovery 
   - Direct URL /agency/update-password -> UserController@handleAgencyPasswordUpdate

2. Form Submission Flow
   - User enters password in recover_password.blade.php
   - Form submits directly to URL /agency/update-password (avoiding named route conflict)
   - handleAgencyPasswordUpdate processes the password update
   - User is redirected to session('return_to') or agency.dashboard

3. Back Link Behavior
   - If session('return_to') is set, show "Back to Dashboard" pointing to that URL
   - Otherwise, show "Back to Login" pointing to agency.login route
